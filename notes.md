# notes
- without sveltekit 
    - the mapped in would have been interesting
    - but with a templating thing like templ go it would have been easier to update the leaderboard etc maybe. its like express accepting a post request and changing the static folder etc. 
    - the state of the commit finalPOST has a working copy of state mutated with a POST request and upon a POST request. 

# functionality
- as soon as you refresh the messages received by clients are erased. Aka its deleted etc.
